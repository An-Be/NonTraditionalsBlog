#Non-Traditionals Blog

A Blog ASP.Net Core (MVC) App. This blog is meant for mainly those who are planning to go into or have already gone into the tech field but have non-traditional backgrounds.
So those who went through a bootcamp, are self taught, just went through an apprenticeship that landed them a position, and more! There are lots of ways to get into tech.
Those with traditional backgrounds are welcome as well! 
For this project I will be using SQLite instead of SQL Server to hold the databases, one for users and one blogs.

Currently a work in progress.
